# LookaBot

What is more important than saving the world?

Colors.

Especially when your mom asks you to pick up some apples.

300m people every day struggle to choose the right apples at the supermarket, why? Cause they're colorblind.

Listen, if you're at the supermarket, you are probably already holding your phone, so we thought we could put a handy helper on it. 

We made a really simple chatbot on telegram, and we backed it up with some vision science.

You select the type of color deficiency you have, you send a picture and Lookabot optimizes the colors to help you to choose the ripe apples (and every other fruit for that matter).

That's it, no world saving this time around, but it can actually be helpful (to a lot of people! 300m, did we mention that?)


## How to try it out?

You can simply look for LookaBot (@look_a_bot) on Telegram and initialize it with the /start command. After selecting the type of color deficiency you're all set to send your first picture. Please note that, depending on the dimension of the image, it might take few seconds to get it back.
